# Flappy-Nerd
Flappy Nerd is an immersive Flappy Bird based game that students can use to study. It uses data scraped from Quizlet, to allow users to choose sets that they want to practice with. Unlike Flappy Bird, the pipes in Flappy Nerd have two gaps. The user must maneuver the bird through the gap with the correct answer to a question that is displayed below, to continue playing.
We created this for the Cupertino Library Hackathon, and this won 2nd prize in the Education category.
